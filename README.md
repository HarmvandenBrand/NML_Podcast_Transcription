## React development instructions

1. Download node package manager (npm): https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`  
    Everytime new dependencies are added and installed by collaborators, you will need to run this command again.
4. Start development server: `npm start`  
    Supports hot reloading, which means that changes saved in your editor will immediately be reflected on the development server (i.e., automatically refreshes).
5. Stop the development server: `Ctrl + C`
